# Function to find a route using A* Search algorithm.

# The A* algorithm usually improves performance by estimating heuristics to minimize cost of the next node visited.
# Total cost is calculated using two metrics: the total distance from the start node to the current node, and the
# estimated cost of moving to a specific node by utilizing a heuristic. When attempting to minimize cost, a lower
# value will indicate a better performing solution.
